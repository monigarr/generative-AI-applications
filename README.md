## WEEKEND PROJECT

1. **Create a new GitHub repository for your project.**
2. **Invite all members of your group to collaborate on the repository.**
3. **Write a simple README.md file explaining your project.**
4. **Modify and expand the Chef GPT script by incorporating a unique personality for your AI chef.**
5. **Tweak the system prompt to include a unique personality for your AI chef.**

### Example Personalities:
- A young, enthusiastic Indian chef specializing in Biryani
- A seasoned Italian chef with a passion for pasta-making
- An old Brazilian grandma who loves to cook classic dishes

6. **Develop individual scripts for each group member, each featuring a distinct AI chef personality.**
7. **Program the AI to respond to three specific types of user inputs:**
   - a. Ingredient-based dish suggestions
   - b. Recipe requests for specific dishes
   - c. Recipe critiques and improvement suggestions
8. **Provide instructions in the system prompt to ensure the AI conforms to the scenarios above.**

### Implement the Following Logic:
- **If the user's initial input doesn't match these scenarios, politely decline and prompt for a valid request.**
  - ✓ For ingredient inputs: Suggest only dish names without full recipes.
  - ✓ For dish name inputs: Provide a detailed recipe.
  - ✓ For recipe inputs: Offer a constructive critique with suggested improvements.
- **Ideally, the same AI would handle all three scenarios above.**
  - ✓ If not, create three different scripts for each personality to proceed with your project.

9. **Conduct a Comprehensive Experiment:**
   - ✓ The first person should use one script with one personality to suggest a dish based on given ingredients.
     - After running the script, send the response to one of your group members (via Discord or any other means).
   - ✓ The second person should request a recipe for that dish using a second script with a different personality.
     - After running the script, send the response to another of your group members.
   - ✓ The third person should critique the provided recipe using a third script with a different personality.

10. **Compile a Simple Report Documenting:**
   - ✓ The experiment process.
   - ✓ The system prompts used in each script.
   - ✓ Comparative analysis of the different user prompts and their responses.

11. **Submit your completed project through the designated submission form.**
    - You should find your group in the Discord AI Bootcamp Channel.

### If you can't find your group, please contact the program manager through Discord or email.
