Bootcamp lesson 4 weekend project

# WEEKEND PROJECT
1  Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2  Invite all members of your group to collaborate on the repository.
3  Write a simple README.md file explaining your project
4  Modify and expand the Chef GPT script by incorporating a unique personality for your AI chef
5  Tweak the system prompt to include a unique personality for your AI chef

# Example personalities:
A young, enthusiastic Indian chef specializing in Biryani
A seasoned Italian chef with a passion for pasta-making
An old Brazilian grandma who loves to cook classic dishes

5  Develop individual scripts for each group member, each featuring a distinct AI chef personality
6  Program the AI to respond to three specific types of user inputs: a. Ingredient-based dish suggestions b. Recipe requests for specific dishes c. Recipe critiques and improvement suggestions
7   Give enough instructions in the system prompt to make the AI conform to give the responses according to the scenarios above

# Implement the following logic:
# If the user's initial input doesn't match these scenarios, politely decline and prompt for a valid request.
✓ For ingredient inputs: Suggest only dish names without full recipes.
✓ For dish name inputs: Provide a detailed recipe.
✓ For recipe inputs: Offer a constructive critique with suggested improvements.
# Ideally, the same AI would be able to handle the three scenarios above
✓ But if you can't get the same AI to do that, you can make three different scripts for each personality to proceed with your project

8  Conduct a comprehensive experiment:
✓ The first person should use one script with one personality to suggest a dish based on given ingredients
    After running the script, send the response for one of your group members (via Discord or any other means)
✓ The second person should request a recipe for that dish using a second script with a different personality
    After running the script, send the response for another of your group members
✓ The third person should critique the provided recipe using a third script with a different personality

9  Compile a simple report documenting:
✓ The experiment process
✓ The system prompts used in each script
✓ Comparative analysis of the different user prompts and their responses

10 Submit your completed project through the designated submission form.
You should find your group in the Discord AI Bootcamp Channel

# If you can't find your group, please contact the program manager through Discord or email
